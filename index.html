    Sometimes I look at you and I’m overwhelmed by how much love my heart can hold for one person ❤.  
    I don’t know how to explain it, but you make everything in my life softer. Even on the days when I feel tired, confused,  
    or unsure of myself, loving you feels like the one thing that is always clear, always steady, always right ✨.  
    You are the calm that my soul leans into, the warmth that fills every quiet space inside me 🫶.  
    You’ve taught me that love isn’t loud or showy — it’s gentle, patient, and consistent 🤍.  
    It’s in the way you listen to me, the way you choose me even when things aren’t perfect,  
    the way you understand the parts of me I don’t say out loud.  
    You make me feel seen in a way I didn’t know was possible.  
    With you, I am never too much, never too quiet, never too emotional — I am simply me, and that is enough 💗.  
    I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.  
    You are kind, thoughtful, strong, and so full of a quiet goodness that makes the world feel safer 🌙.  
    Being loved by you is the biggest blessing of my life.  
    And I hope you never forget this: I am here. With you, for you, always.  
    My heart has chosen you in every possible way, and every single day I keep falling for you all over again 💞.

I look at this picture, our first moment captured in time and honestly, it breaks me a little 🥺.  
It breaks me because I see a woman who had no idea how completely her life was about to be consumed by the man holding her. You obviously. 🫀  

I look at your hand on my face, the way you’re leaning in, and I feel an ache in my chest that is so heavy it’s hard to breathe 😩.  
You have this terrifying power over me. In this photo, you are not just kissing me, you are sheltering me, claiming me, and quieting every storm I have ever felt ❤️‍🔥.  
It scares me how much I need you. It scares me that before you, I was just existing and now the thought of a single day without you feels like my world is ending 🌎💔.  

You are my weakness and my greatest strength. When you hold me like this, I feel small and safe — like I can finally put down all the armor I have been wearing my whole life because you are there to protect me 🫂.  
You stripped my defenses down to nothing without even trying.  

I am so hopelessly in love with you that it physically hurts staying away from you 😭.  
You are the only person who has ever seen the rawest parts of me and stayed.  
You are my home, my soulmate, my obsession, my survival.  

I don’t just want you baby, I crave you.  
I need you like I need air.

Loving you is the most vulnerable thing I have ever done.  
Before you I was so good at keeping my guard up and hiding the messy parts of myself.  
But with you there are no walls 🚫.  
You see everything — the crazy, the weird, the breakdown moments and you don’t run away. You stay.  
You just hold me through it ❤️‍🩹.  

I don’t say this enough but I am very much very grateful that you exist.  
Just knowing you are in this world makes everything better 🌍.  
You have become my safe place.  
On days where I feel like I am too much or a total mess you make me feel like I’m still worth loving.  
You make me feel like I don’t have to pretend to be perfect.  

You are the only person who truly knows me, baby.  
It’s overwhelming sometimes to realize how much my happiness is tied to you now.

I don’t just miss your face or your laugh—I miss you. I miss the weight of your body next to mine, the way your hands feel on my skin, and that electric feeling I get when you just look at me a certain way. 🥵🔥 My body literally aches for you. It’s like an addiction and I’m going through the worst withdrawals. I catch myself day-dreaming about the next time I can finally touch you, kiss you and just lose myself in you completely or maybe you could lose yourself completely inside me. 🤤💋

You are my obsession, my best friend and the only man who knows exactly how to drive me crazy. 😈 I hate this distance but god it just reminds me of how much I belong to you. I am yours—mind, body and soul. Every inch of me is just waiting for you to come back and claim it.

So consider this your warning: when this distance is finally closed I am not letting you go. I’m going to make up for every single day we have spent apart. 😉🔥

I can literally feel your hunger from here babe. 😣🔥 I know you’re starving for that feeling of possessing me completely. I know you miss the way I melt under your touch, the way I look up at you when you take charge and the way I let you do absolutely anything you want to me. 🫠🥴 You need that release and god I hate that I’m not there to give it to you right now.

But I want you to know something and I need you to remember this for the next 20 nights: I am saving every single inch of myself just for you. 🎁💍🔒

When you finally get to me...I am not going to ask for anything. I’m just going to surrender. 🏳️ I am going to be so good for you sweetheart. 🥺 Use me to get rid of all this frustration. Take all that pent-up energy and pour it into me until you’re finally satisfied. 😈🌊 I want to be your playground, your stress relief and your obsession all at once. 🧸🗝️

No talking, no holding back and definitely no sleeping. 🙅‍♀️🛌 Just you taking exactly what you need for as long as you need it. I am yours to break, yours to fix and yours to enjoy. 🤤🩸I want you to wreck me until I can’t even remember my own name. 🫠🥴

The 650kms between us feels like a cruel joke sometimes but it has also taught me something so important: my soul is tied to yours no matter the distance. 🌏🔗

From being my best friend to becoming my soulmate you’ve held my heart in your hands and you’ve been so gentle with it. 💍😭 I get scared sometimes thinking about how much power you have over me simply because I love you this deeply. You are my anchor, my calm in the chaos and the reason I believe in forever.

We are counting down the days, but honestly I am counting every single heartbeat that I have to spend away from you. This distance these damn 650 kilometers between us feels like a physical weight on my chest tonight. It hurts Shubh. It hurts because I need you like I need air and you are not here. But even with all this space between us there is one absolute truth that keeps me sane: You own me. 🔗💍 
I need you to really hear me right now. I don’t just love you I am consumed by you. You have claimed every part of who I am. My body, my mind, my soul—it’s all yours. There is no version of me that exists without you anymore. I have surrendered myself to you completely and I would lay my life down just to keep you safe. 🛐😭 
I know I can be a lot sometimes. I know we have our moments. But please never ever let a doubt cross your mind about my intentions. The thought of being the reason for your pain terrifies me more than death. I would destroy myself before I would ever intentionally hurt you. You are the most precious thing I have ever touched and I treat your heart like it’s the only thing that matters in this universe. 🌍💔 
I am yours baby in this life and the next. You hold the remote to my happiness and I belong to you in a way I have never belonged to anyone or anything before.
