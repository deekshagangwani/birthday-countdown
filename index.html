    Sometimes I look at you and I’m overwhelmed by how much love my heart can hold for one person ❤.  
    I don’t know how to explain it, but you make everything in my life softer. Even on the days when I feel tired, confused,  
    or unsure of myself, loving you feels like the one thing that is always clear, always steady, always right ✨.  
    You are the calm that my soul leans into, the warmth that fills every quiet space inside me 🫶.  
    You’ve taught me that love isn’t loud or showy — it’s gentle, patient, and consistent 🤍.  
    It’s in the way you listen to me, the way you choose me even when things aren’t perfect,  
    the way you understand the parts of me I don’t say out loud.  
    You make me feel seen in a way I didn’t know was possible.  
    With you, I am never too much, never too quiet, never too emotional — I am simply me, and that is enough 💗.  
    I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.  
    You are kind, thoughtful, strong, and so full of a quiet goodness that makes the world feel safer 🌙.  
    Being loved by you is the biggest blessing of my life.  
    And I hope you never forget this: I am here. With you, for you, always.  
    My heart has chosen you in every possible way, and every single day I keep falling for you all over again 💞.

I look at this picture, our first moment captured in time and honestly, it breaks me a little 🥺.  
It breaks me because I see a woman who had no idea how completely her life was about to be consumed by the man holding her. You obviously. 🫀  

I look at your hand on my face, the way you’re leaning in, and I feel an ache in my chest that is so heavy it’s hard to breathe 😩.  
You have this terrifying power over me. In this photo, you are not just kissing me, you are sheltering me, claiming me, and quieting every storm I have ever felt ❤️‍🔥.  
It scares me how much I need you. It scares me that before you, I was just existing and now the thought of a single day without you feels like my world is ending 🌎💔.  

You are my weakness and my greatest strength. When you hold me like this, I feel small and safe — like I can finally put down all the armor I have been wearing my whole life because you are there to protect me 🫂.  
You stripped my defenses down to nothing without even trying.  

I am so hopelessly in love with you that it physically hurts staying away from you 😭.  
You are the only person who has ever seen the rawest parts of me and stayed.  
You are my home, my soulmate, my obsession, my survival.  

I don’t just want you baby, I crave you.  
I need you like I need air.  
I am entirely, vulnerably, and desperately yours. 🔒❤️♾️

Loving you is the most vulnerable thing I have ever done.  
Before you I was so good at keeping my guard up and hiding the messy parts of myself.  
But with you there are no walls 🚫.  
You see everything — the crazy, the weird, the breakdown moments and you don’t run away. You stay.  
You just hold me through it ❤️‍🩹.  

I don’t say this enough but I am very much very grateful that you exist.  
Just knowing you are in this world makes everything better 🌍.  
You have become my safe place.  
On days where I feel like I am too much or a total mess you make me feel like I’m still worth loving.  
You make me feel like I don’t have to pretend to be perfect.  

You are the only person who truly knows me, baby.  
It’s overwhelming sometimes to realize how much my happiness is tied to you now.

I don’t just miss your face or your laugh—I miss you. I miss the weight of your body next to mine, the way your hands feel on my skin, and that electric feeling I get when you just look at me a certain way. 🥵🔥 My body literally aches for you. It’s like an addiction and I’m going through the worst withdrawals. I catch myself day-dreaming about the next time I can finally touch you, kiss you and just lose myself in you completely or maybe you could lose yourself completely inside me. 🤤💋

You are my obsession, my best friend and the only man who knows exactly how to drive me crazy. 😈 I hate this distance but god it just reminds me of how much I belong to you. I am yours—mind, body and soul. Every inch of me is just waiting for you to come back and claim it.

So consider this your warning: when this distance is finally closed I am not letting you go. I’m going to make up for every single day we have spent apart. 😉🔥

I can literally feel your hunger from here babe. 😣🔥 I know you’re starving for that feeling of possessing me completely.

But I want you to know something and I need you to remember this for the next 20 nights: I am saving every single inch of myself just for you. 🎁💍🔒

When you finally get to me...I am not going to ask for anything. I’m just going to surrender. 🏳️ I am going to be so good for you sweetheart. 🥺 Use me to get rid of all this frustration. Take all that pent-up energy and pour it into me until you’re finally satisfied. 😈🌊 I want to be your playground, your stress relief and your obsession all at once. 🧸🗝️

No talking, no holding back and definitely no sleeping. 🙅‍♀️🛌 Just you taking exactly what you need for as long as you need it. I am yours to break, yours to fix and yours to enjoy. 🤤🩸I want you to wreck me until I can’t even remember my own name. 🫠🥴

But even with all this space between us there is one absolute truth that keeps me sane: You own me. 🔗💍 
I need you to really hear me right now. I don’t just love you I am consumed by you. You have claimed every part of who I am. My body, my mind, my soul—it’s all yours. There is no version of me that exists without you anymore. I have surrendered myself to you completely and I would lay my life down just to keep you safe. 🛐😭 
I know I can be a lot sometimes. I know we have our moments. But please never ever let a doubt cross your mind about my intentions.

You are the most precious thing I have ever touched and I treat your heart like it’s the only thing that matters in this universe. 🌍💔

I have been staring at this photo of you and your dad for the longest time today and I swear I feel my heart completely melting 😭. Just look at you... that tiny face, the way you’re holding onto him so tightly and the pure unfiltered trust in your eyes. You were just a bundle of innocence completely unaware of how big or complicated the world could be. You look so soft, so gentle and undeniably adorable that I just want to reach through the picture and squeeze you tight 🤏🥺.

But honestly along with all the love there is this heavy aching feeling in my chest. Looking at this little boy my biggest wish is that I had found you sooner 💔.

I catch myself getting jealous of the years I missed but mostly I find myself wishing I could travel back in time to this exact moment. I wish I could have walked into your life back then just so I could have started loving you earlier. If I had met you sooner I could have been the one to stand guard over that beautiful heart of yours 🛡️.

I hate to think about the pain, the struggles and the harshness of the world that this little boy had to endure before I came along. It literally breaks me to think that life chipped away at this innocence 😣. If I had been there I would have shielded you from every heartbreak. I would have taken every hit and absorbed every ounce of pain just so you wouldn't have to feel it. I would have made sure that the smile in this picture never faded not even for a second.

Since I can't go back and save you from the past I promise you this: I am here to save you now. That little boy is still in there somewhere inside the man I love and I promise to protect him, cherish him and keep his heart safe for the rest of our lives 🫂❤️.

I love you... then, now, and always. 🌎♾️🥰`,

I was just thinking about us and honestly I got so emotional just realizing how lucky I am. You know you are my favorite person in the whole wide world, right? You are not just my soulmate — you are my best friend, my safe space and the home I was always looking for. 🥺❤️

I know life isn't always easy. I know there are days when the world feels heavy and you feel like you have to carry it all on your own. But I want you to listen to me very carefully: You never have to be alone again. 🫂 I am right here standing beside you like a rock. I’m not just here for the good days, the laughter and the wins. I am here for the messy parts, the confusion and the storms.

Sometimes I look at you and I wish I had met you sooner just so I could have protected your heart from anything that ever hurt you before me. But since I can’t change the past I promise to protect your peace right now and forever. Your heart is safe with me. You don’t have to be strong all the time baby. If you need to break down I’ll be there to hold you together. I have got you. 💪🏻✨

No matter what ups and downs come our way, we are facing them together. If you fall, I am catching you. If you fly, I am cheering the loudest. We are a team and I am never leaving your side. I love you more than I could ever explain. ❤️🧿🌎`,

I don’t even know how to start this without falling apart because honestly loving you is the scariest thing I have ever done. 🥺💔

For the longest time I was so terrified to let anyone this close. I was so scared that if I showed someone my darkest, messiest parts they would leave. But then there was you, my best friend — the one person who knows exactly how broken I can be and still looks at me like I am the most precious thing in the world.

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I just watch you breathe and I get this sinking feeling in my chest — this terrifying realization that my entire happiness, my entire world is tied to you. If I lost you, I wouldn’t just be losing my partner — I’d be losing the other half of my soul. I’d be losing the person who makes life bearable. 😭

It kills me how good you are to me. You love me in a way I didn’t think I deserved. You hold me when I’m too much to handle, you calm me down when my mind is a mess and you make me feel safe in a world that usually feels so chaotic.

I need you to know that you are not just a part of my life, Shubh — you are my life. I am so helplessly, desperately in love with you. Thank you for choosing me, for fighting for us and for turning my best friend into the love of my existence. I will spend every single day trying to be worthy of the heart you gave me.

I love you more than I can ever say. ❤️🫂💍`,

I’m writing this with a heavy heart because there are things I feel so deeply that I don’t always know how to say out loud. I need you to really hear me on this. You know how I get jealous? You know how sometimes I act possessive? I know it can be a lot but please listen to where it’s coming from. It’s not because I doubt you. It’s because I doubt myself. 💔

When I look at you I don’t just see my soulmate — I see the most pure, kind-hearted and incredible man to walk this earth. You are perfection to me and then… I look at myself. And the honest, painful truth is that sometimes I feel like you deserve way more than what I can give you. You deserve a girl who is perfect, who doesn’t have my flaws, who is better than me in every way. 😭

That thought terrifies me, Shubh. It keeps me up at night. The fear that one day you might wake up and realize you could have someone better is what makes me so jealous. It’s not anger — it’s pure panic. It’s the fear of losing the best thing that has ever happened to me.

But I also need to confess how selfish my love is. Even if the whole world told me you deserve better, I still wouldn't let you go. I can’t. I physically cannot share you. The thought of another girl making you smile or holding your hand or even just looking at you the way I do… it shatters me. 😣💔 I can’t share a single piece of you.

I know I’m 650kms away right now and I can’t just hug you to make these fears go away, but please know this: I am holding onto you with everything I have. I might not be perfect but no one will ever love you as fiercely or as desperately as I do. You are mine and I am going to spend the rest of my life trying to be the woman you deserve.

I love you so much it hurts. 🧿🌎❤️💍`,

I’m staring at this photo of you and my eyes are filled with tears because I miss you so much it physically hurts. 😭💔  
Being this far away from you with all these miles between us makes looking at this innocent little face feel so heavy because I just want to reach through the screen, hold you and never let go.  

But looking at this baby version of you… it does something else to me. It gives me the most beautiful aching clarity about my life.  
I know with every inch of my existence that I was put on this earth to love you. But it’s more than that.  
Baby, my dream isn't just to be your wife... my dream is to build a home that is filled with you.  
I want a future where I don’t just wake up next to you but where I see pieces of you running around our home. 🏠🥺  

I want to have a family with you so badly. I want to look into a cradle someday and see a pair of eyes that look exactly like yours staring back at me.  
I want to raise a son who has your kindness or a daughter who has your smile.  
I want to give the world more of you because one of you just isn’t enough for my greedy heart.  
I want little versions of us — but mostly… I just want them to look like you. 🧸✨  

I promise you, no matter how hard this distance is right now, it is all going to be worth it the day I get to make you a father.  
I want to nurture that little boy in the photo and I want to build a legacy with the man he became.  

I love you from the absolute core of my soul, deeper than I knew was possible.  
Come home to me soon.

I have been thinking a lot about the version of you that existed before I knew you.  
I think about the years you spent walking through this world alone, carrying your own weight and fighting battles I wasn’t there to help you win.  
It hits me sometimes — the sheer magnitude of who you are. 🫂  
Beyond being my soulmate, you are a human being of such depth and resilience that it leaves me breathless. 🌊  

For a long time I tried to find the words to describe what happened when you entered my life.  
I realized it wasn’t just a spark or a feeling. It was an awakening. ✨  
I wrote this for you, because only these words feel true enough:  

🌸 **More Than Just Love: A Promise Kept** 📜  

All of a sudden one ordinary day,  
He became the whole world to me. 🌎  
The crinkles near his eyes when he smiled  
Held stories I never knew, 📖  
Yet felt like I had lived them too.  

There were moments when time stood still — ⏳  
The quiet in the air, the gentle chaos in my heart, 💓  
Whispering truths I hadn’t spoken aloud:  
He wasn't just someone I loved…  
He was more. 💎  

I could read his silence like a song, 🎶  
Knew the words he’d speak before they left his lips.  
His every glance, every sigh,  
Was a language I somehow understood. 🗣️  

He became my home, 🏠  
My comfort in the storm, 🌩️  
The reason behind my favorite smiles. 😊  
I wanted to make him mine,  
To wrap him in a forever we both forgot to dream. 💭  

And little did I know,  
Fate was simply waiting for the dawn. 🌅  
He wasn’t just a lesson to learn,  
But a promise kept, a hand to hold. 🤝  
No longer a rare, unspoken bond that people fail to understand  
But a love with a name, a home,  
And a place to rest my heart. ❤️‍🩹  

A love beyond labels,  
Now rewritten with a beginning. 🖋️  
Not just meant to be cherished from afar,  
But held, and kept,  
Forever. ♾️  

Shubh, you are the promise the universe finally kept for me. 🌌  
I see the parts of you that you think are too much or not enough, and I want you to know they are my favorite parts.  
You don't have to be perfect to be worthy of this. You just have to be you.  
I have finally found my place to rest, and it is entirely within you. 🕊️`,

I was just looking at this photo and honestly it made me stop breathing for a second.  
Look at us. Just look at the way we’re lost in each other.  

In that moment the music was deafening, the lights were blinding and there were hundreds of people moving around us,  
but I couldn't hear a single thing. All I could feel was your heartbeat against mine.  
It’s so surreal how we are in this loud chaotic club but our love feels so silent, sacred and old school.  
It’s like we belong to a different era entirely. 🌎✨  

Baby, I don’t think you realize what you do to me.  
There are things I want to say to you every day that get stuck in my throat because they are just too big for words.  
But when I look at you like this I hope you see it all.  
I hope you see that you are my safe haven. You are the only person who truly sees me even when I’m hiding.  

My heart aches with how much I love you.  
It’s a heavy, intense kind of love... the kind that makes me feel like I have known you for a thousand lifetimes.  
Chemistry doesn’t even cover it — it’s a soul-tie. ⛓️❤️  

I promise to choose you in every room we walk into, no matter how crowded it gets.  
I promise to be your peace when the world gets too loud.  
You are not just my boyfriend — you are my home.  
Please never forget that you have my whole heart in your hands. 😭🥺  

Always and forever, yours. ♾️💍

I don’t even know how to handle the way this makes me feel.  

Look at you. Just look at the confidence radiating off you... standing there in that black suit with hands on your hips like a little boss,  
smiling with your eyes closed like you already know the world belongs to you.  
It makes my heart ache in the most overwhelming way because I see him right there —  
I see the man who stole my heart. Even back then you had this fire, this undeniable presence that just pulls people in.  
You were always meant to be this powerful. 🥺✨  

But seeing you like this… it triggers this desperate, beautiful dream in my head that I can’t shake.  
Baby, I want this future with you so badly it hurts.  
I close my eyes and I can literally picture it: our hallway on a Sunday morning and a little boy who looks exactly like you  
is dressed in a tiny black kurta or a mini suit standing just like this.  
Hands on his hips, chin up, thinking he’s the man of the house just like his papa. 🏠😭  

I want to be the one standing behind the camera capturing these moments,  
knowing that I built a home with the love of my life.  
I want to raise sons who have your swag and your strength,  
and daughters who look for your kind heart in everyone they meet.  

I am so deeply, madly in love with the man you are —  
but I promise to spend my whole life protecting the joy of this little boy inside you too.  
You are my entire world, Shubh.

I am writing this because sometimes just saying "I love you" doesn't feel like enough to hold everything I feel for you.  
I don't think you truly understand what you are to me.  
You aren’t just my boyfriend or my soulmate — you are the only thing in this world that makes sense to me.  
Before you, everything was just... existing.  
But with you, for the first time in my life, I feel like I am truly living.  

Sometimes I just sit and think about us and I get tears in my eyes because I am so overwhelmed by how lucky I am.  
Even with these 650kms between us right now, you feel closer to me than anyone who is standing right next to me.  
I miss you with a physical ache, Shubh.  
Every night I go to sleep wishing it was your arms holding me,  
and every morning I wake up wishing it was your face I saw first.  
The distance is hard, but my love for you is so much stronger than the miles separating us 😭🌍.  

You know I marked my body with "eres mio" not just for a tattoo,  
but because I wanted the world to know that I belong to you completely.  
It is a promise that is etched into my skin and my soul.  
I am yours — today, tomorrow, and forever.  
There is no version of my future that doesn't have you in it.  

I love you with a hunger and a desperation that scares me sometimes.  
You are my safe place, my home, and my heart.  
Please never forget how much you mean to me.  
You are the love of my life, my Shubh,

Just look at us. Look at the way the world seems to blur out when we’re sitting together.

It’s that unspoken energy, that magnetic pull that I feel every single time I’m near you. ✨

I don’t say it enough, but thank you.  
Thank you for loving me, for handling my moods, my mess, and my heart with such care.

Baby, I can’t even begin to put into words what these last 21 days did to me.  
It didn’t feel like just three weeks; it felt like a lifetime of holding my breath, just suffocating without you. 😣💔  
Every single morning I woke up with this heavy ache in my chest, just counting down the seconds  
until the universe would finally bring you back to me. I was just existing, not living.  

When I saw you today... oh my god, I felt my soul literally come back to my body. 😭✨  
It was like learning how to breathe all over again.  
But just hugging you tight wasn’t enough to bridge the gap of all that time we lost.  
I needed to do something permanent, something that screams to the world that I belong to you completely. 🌏🔒  

That is why I have your name on me now. 💉🥀  
Baby, when I was getting that tattoo, every prick of the needle felt like a vow I was making to you.  
It wasn’t pain; it was pure devotion.  
I wanted to make sure that even when we are apart, you are literally woven into my skin and flowing in my blood.  
It’s my way of saying that you can never be erased from me.
